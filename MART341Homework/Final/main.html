            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>I had faced some challenges through the semester and this taught me how to think it through and complete each assignment. I expected to face these since I was new to coding for websites. I learned from this that sometimes you have to go a different route to try and fix what has happened or just tweak it a bit to work in my favor. Some things I was not able to figure out on my own, and that helped me understand that there is still a lot I can learn from. The challenges I faced were placement and sometimes sizing of elements.<br>
            </br>
            I am open to failing and learning from that. I am grateful for my instructor's advice on how to fix things that I just could not figure out! Challenges are a part of life and I will not feel disheartened by them. I have learned a lot from this class and really enjoyed the challenges I face to improve my understanding of coding and web design! I hope to use these skills I learned to further my knowledge for Media Arts and apply them to my future career.</p>

            <h2>Success</h2>
            <p>From what I learned I became more successful with each assignment. I applied what I learned from each week's course work, that shows from my assignments and to this last webpage I will make for this course. I was able to understand the course work and apply that to my webpages. I think the most I succeeded in was color, font and layout. Each of these I think I have learned well to incorporate it into my webpages. <br>
            </br>
            Understanding what colors work well together and being able to keep the website eligable with the color, while also making the desing work well together.Font, using each style of font that works well and gives the webpage a stylistic and to keep it easy to read. Layout keep things organized and easy flow of information and keeping it stylish as well. Each of these are important for a webpage to give the information but also allow the viewer to be able to navigate, read and enjoy the style of the webpage. I truly learned a lot and have applied my skills and new skills into this course.</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p style="text-align: center;">I learned a lot from this class. I was super nervous at first but excited at the same time. Since I have not had a lot of experience with coding, it was a new experience and a new learning curve for me. I felt I was able to learn more and understand more how it works. When making my first webpage I knew it was going to be basic and that as I furthered my education in this course I would add more skills to apply to my webpages. As I gained new skills to apply to my webpages I could see the improvement of my learning and understanding of coding web design. It was interesting to see how much each new thing I learned could change my webpages.</p>
