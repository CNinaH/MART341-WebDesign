Position- Tried to use this on the table and contact form to make them in the middle. 
Margin- Used margins on my h1 and h2. Though I still can't get the words to be centered with the box from the top.
Border- I used a border on the navigation section.
Sizing-max-width on navigation to make it match the h1 size.
Padding-I used to move the images away from the edges. Tried to make them in square 2x2 but it didn't work the way Io wanted too so I left in a line. 
Display-Tried the the display in block for the Navigation section.
