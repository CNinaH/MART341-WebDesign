1. How did the disscusion post go? I added a color to my website, and tried to fix the spacing and value of the colors. I wanted to fix the containers but they would not block down in a upside down pyramid.
2. I am focusing on brewingtea.html for this assignment.
3. for the class and id selectors I used the same div information-section/step-section and infortmaion/step.
4. Different font color, positioning and spacing.
