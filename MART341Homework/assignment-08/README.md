Div- hero video, images and aduido. I wanted to show case the video at the top, the images was hard to get them to be equal and had to mess with the layout for the width more. At first they stacked in a stair case way, I wasn't going to use the border box but then used them because it worked to keep them in line more and just made them the same color as the back ground. Audio section I could not get it to align in the center but if it was to the left or right it would mess with the footers layout and cause it to go above the song. 
Span- impotant information of the type of program used to make the art and information of the song.
