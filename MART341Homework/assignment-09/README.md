Tools needed, a kettle is preferred but you can use a stove pot. You will need a strainer to hold the loose leaf tea in, if you do not have one, stores do carry them and can be found on online stores as well and thermometers. 

Write out steps
Boil the 1-2 cups of water depending on how many you are serving, to the right temp indicated for the tea. 
Fill the strainer with tea, do not over pact this. The tea will expand and need room to grow. Some teas tell you how much a serving is, usually 1-2 teaspoons (tspn).
	
	Optional, if you want a sweetener like sugar or honey, if you pour some hot water 	to dissolve and then add the strainer and rest of hot water in.  

Once the water has reached its temp pour into the cup with the strainer in. 
Let sit for the required time. 
Take the strainer out once done and clean out immediately, to reuse shortly after or to put away. Dried tea is hard to clean out later. 
Enjoy!

Milk Tea 

Same as brewing with some other steps to it. But it will need to be concentrate. 

Boil the 1-2 cups of water depending on how many you are serving, to the right temp indicated for the tea. 

If you have a bigger strainer the better if not you will need to pack the strainer with more tea or use 2 strainers. You will need more tea than normal since you are going to make a concentrated tea. Usually it is 1-2 teaspoons (tspn) but you will double this. The reason for this is because you donâ€™t want to dilute the tea when adding the milk in.

Optional, if you want a sweetener like sugar or honey, if you pour some hot water 	to dissolve and then add the strainer and rest of hot water in. 

Once the water has reached its temp pour into the container holding your tea and pour to let it sit. I suggest using a bigger cup/mug since you will be adding milk into the tea. I tend to steep my tea in a 8 oz tea pot and then add the tea and milk into the cup or mug I am using to drink out of. 

Let sit for a minute or 2 more than the normal time since you will need to make sure it steeps all the flavor. 

In the meantime, steam the milk. If you have a steamer then it is easy to steam but if not use a stove pot. Which will need to be steamed to desired temp of 160 degrees Fahrenheit on low-medium. Stir with a whisk constantly, this keeps the milk from forming a skim. Stir gently so as to not make a mess. Takes about at most 10 seconds. Just keep an eye on the milk and if you have the thermometer you can check the temp. 

Take the strainer out once done and clean out immediately, to reuse shortly after or to put away. Dried tea is hard to clean out later. 

Add the milk when done steaming. 

Enjoy!
