A class I truly enjoyed? There is two that I had enjoyed, Painting at the Helena College and Intro to Animation at the UOM. The painting was because learning a new form of art I didn't really try before, and seeing how much I could learn from that class. Fror the Intro to Animation is because I have always been a fan of animation and stop motion animation, one my favorite studio is Laika Studios.
