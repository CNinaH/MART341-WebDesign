At Least 4 Pages – I have made my 4 webpages cohesive with style, color and font. 
Responsive Design – I tried this and not sure if it worked. I can't get the video on the digital.html to fit the scren size. 
Media Queries – I don't know if I did this right.

Dropdown Menu – This did not work with my menue.
