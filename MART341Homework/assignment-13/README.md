At Least 4 Pages – I have made my 4 webpages cohesive with style, color and font. 
Responsive Design – Tried not sure if it right. Can't seem to get the mobile phone diplay correct. Was not sure where this went for the navigation, if I put in the naviagation area it messed with the layout and made it go right though I used float center. 
Media Queries – I don't know if I did this right. 
Navigation Menu – Made my navigation clean and easy to see and navigate.  
Dropdown Menu – This did not work with my menue.
