        <P>
            At an early age I was fascinated by art, my Grandma was a billboard painter for Helena MT. She had a big studio in her garage, filled with all different kinds of paints and tools. I grew up watching her paint billboards. From then on shows, comic books and other forms of media interested me in how they were created. I am a 90s kid and have watched the animation in shows and movies grow into what it is now. Animation is what got me into wanting to get my degree in Media Arts. I also fell in love with Stop-Motion movies.<br>
        </br>

            I didn't start college until I was 23, until then I was also on the fence about going into sound design. But I made the decision to start my generals at Helena College and would decide from there. I graduated with my Associates in the fall of 2020. Unfortunately, I got really sick and was diagnosed with cancer. I had to push off starting my Bachelors degree for 2 years. When I felt ready to go back, I was nervous starting at the University of Montana because I have never had any experience working with digital art. My main form of art is pencil and ink (pens, markers). I have done some painting. I started at the University of Montana in 2022 and have learned so much from the different forms of Media Arts. I still have more to learn and I am excited for that. I am also close to Graduating which makes me happy to know I have done so much this far into my degree.
