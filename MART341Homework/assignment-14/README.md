3 pages- I have 4 pages.
I would add the Dark Theme but to be honest I wasn't sure how to relate that into the test.html and it doesn't seem to work for the website. Not sure how to make it work. I tried following the website for Bootstrap but I guess I dfon't understand what is needed. 
Framework Styling Elements – I was not able to figure this out. 
HTML5 Canvas – I did stroke text.
JavaScript Functionality – Tried this with text both drawa and stroke and I went with Stroke.
