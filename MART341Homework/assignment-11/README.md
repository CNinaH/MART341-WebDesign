Create a page with an external CSS style sheet- I applied what I learned the last 2 weeks on css in the style sheet. Alignments, color and text.
Add hover effects to enhance interactivity- I used it on my navigation section.
Use an external font that is self-hosted- I wasn't too sure what this meant. I used the @font-face and applied it to my fonts I got from Google.
Use an external font from a font library- Used GoogleFonts to use fonts. 
Experiment with different font styles- I choose 3 different fonts and used them for varies text in my webpage.
Align text or elements for a clean layout-I messed with each text I could to make them align with the center and make sure it was big enough to read as well. 
Use text-decoration to add or remove underlines, lines through text, etc.- I used this on my Navigation section.
